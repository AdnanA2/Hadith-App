# üìñ PRD: Hadith of the Day (iOS-first Mobile App)

---

## 1. Overview
**Product:** Hadith of the Day  
**Platform:** iOS (MVP)
**Target Users:** English-speaking American Muslims seeking daily authentic hadith reminders with clarity and simplicity.  
**Core Value:** Provide one authentic hadith per day (Arabic + English) with option to explore and share more hadiths.  

The app balances **authenticity, readability, and engagement**: every hadith shows its source and grade, users can easily save/share, and the design is minimal but modern.

---

## 2. Goals & Objectives
- Deliver one hadith daily with notification and date badge.  
- Allow endless scrolling through Riyad us-Saliheen (~1900 hadiths).  
- Enable favorites/bookmarks for personal collections.  
- Support sharing both as text and styled image cards.  
- Ensure offline-first experience (bundled SQLite DB).  
- Provide Arabic + English side-by-side.  
- Filter hadiths by chapter/topic.  
- Prioritize authenticity (chain, source, grading always shown).  
- Offer a clean, minimal UI with dark mode and streaks for habit-building.  

---

## 3. Competitive Analysis
**Existing Apps & Insights:**  
- **Hadith of the Day (official):** daily reminder + community brand. Users like push reminders but app design is dated.  
- **My Daily Hadith:** supports 6 languages, daily push, text/image sharing. Users value offline use and customization.  
- **Hadith Collection (IRD/Greentech):** 41k+ hadiths, all major books, bookmarks, search, grades. Users praise comprehensiveness and authenticity.  
- **Hadithi (AI-powered):** focuses on chain of narration and references with sleek UI.  

**What users like:**  
- Easy daily reminders.  
- Offline access.  
- Clean Arabic + English text.  
- Shareable as image.  

**What users dislike:**  
- Broken sharing features.  
- Poor readability.  
- Lack of dark mode.  
- Missing authenticity info.  

**Opportunity:** Build a modern, reliable, offline-first daily hadith app with a strong focus on authenticity and UI quality.

## 4. Dataset & Content
**Primary Collection (MVP):** Riyad us-Saliheen (~1900 hadiths).  

**Sources:**

- Open-source Hadith JSON DB (includes Riyad us-Saliheen in Arabic + English).

**Requirements:**  
- Arabic + English for each hadith.  
- Narrator, source collection, book number.  
- Authenticity grading (Sahih, Hasan, etc.).  
- Chapter/topic titles.  

---

## 5. Tech Stack

- **Authenticity:** always display source + grading; exclude weak/fabricated hadith.  
- **Performance:** pre-indexed SQLite, lazy loading.  
- **User misinterpretation:** include chapter titles, optional disclaimer.  
- **Scalability:** modular DB schema for adding collections.  
- **Monetization:** avoid intrusive ads; donation/supporter model.

## 13. Research Prompt
To guide deeper validation, run this master prompt:  

> *‚ÄúI am building an iOS-first app called Hadith of the Day. It shows a daily hadith from Riyad us-Saliheen, supports endless scrolling, favorites, sharing, offline mode, notifications, and dark mode. Users are English-speaking American Muslims. Provide a detailed analysis of: competitor apps (strengths/weaknesses), best open datasets for hadith (Arabic + English), optimal offline-first mobile stack, database schema, best UX practices for spiritual reminder apps, risks (translation licensing, performance, authenticity), and roadmap for scaling to multiple collections. Include references where possible.‚Äù*
